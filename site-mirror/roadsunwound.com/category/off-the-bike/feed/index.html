<p>More has happened in the three weeks since my return to the states than could have happened in months of bike travel.  I had a job offer in my lap less than 24 hrs after landing in Denver, and made the quick turn-around to be back in MT as soon as possible.  First, I snuck up to Fort Collins to congratulate my cousin on his graduation from CSU.  Then, I climbed back on Surly Sue and spent a good chunk of a day riding from Denver to Colorado Springs with my sister&#8217;s boyfriend, Brian.  We made it as far as Monument before taking refuge from a spring thunderstorm in my favorite coffee house, Seranos (hand roasted coffee on the premise).  From there I connected up with the Sante Fe trail that runs through the Air Force Academy grounds and down to Colorado Springs.  The trail was soggy, and the temps were a million degrees colder than anything I had dealt with in Central America.  Because of the rain, I had the trail to myself, and was in heaven.  Mud, dirt, grit, determination, pain, chills, burns, and a warm shower, fire, and hot tub at the end.  What was all that bike-touring, self-mutilation, all about?</p>

<p>I came in hot to Bozeman and was fortunate to overlap with some good friends who were also visiting town.  Our go-to brewery, the Bozone, is under remodel, but 406 stepped in to fill the void and give me a place for a welcome back toast with some great friends.  An apartment had slipped into my lap about as effortlessly as the job, and I spent a few days moving in and tracking down all my random things about town.  I can&#8217;t complain about being able to sit next to the duck-ponds along the Galligator trail with a steaming cup of coffee, or a cold beer.  I am thrilled at my new place.</p>
<p>At work, Medicine Hat Inc. (that emblem stitched to my black fleece that was a curiosity to so many on the road), was in a pinch on a project deadline and I jumped right into throw sparks and mold metal.  Having settled into a permanent room, my body finally found its chance to rest, and I was flattened by some illness.  It overlapped with a trip to Rapid City to congratulate my step-sister on her graduation from HS as Valedictorian (which I misspelled at first, but since I am not in those highly intelligent ranks it doesn&#8217;t concern me).</p>

<p>The irons were in the fire when I got back to work last Monday and didn&#8217;t subside until the varmint trailer was delivered this Saturday.  Long days (14 hours) in glorious springtime Montana were the name of the game.  By glorious I mean, cold, windy, wet, and snowy &#8211; damn, it sure was good to be back.  We had a special project and deadline for the client that we were involved with before I departed on my trip 2 yrs ago.  It was a great opportunity to get back into the thick of things; get dirty, use muscles not required for pedaling a bike, and make some outrageous stuff.  In ten days we turned a flat-bed trailer into a customized mobile gopher hunting platform.  On Saturday, when we delivered the trailer, I was able to see the finished pre-fab house that took some of my blood and sweat, but also funded the first section of my adventure.  It is an amazing project.</p>

<p>Life is throwing things at me in rapid succession, which I take as a sign that I am supposed to be back and moving on with the next stage.  I don&#8217;t know what all this will result in, perhaps a move to Boston or Portland, but just having options and deciphering the value of each one on my future is a pleasure I had forfeited towards the end of my trip.  I don&#8217;t feel lost and alone, and that is immeasurably important.  Oh, and I can pick up my road bike with one hand, smile, and take a picture of some snowy mountains on a new loop ride around Bozeman!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A rampant worldwide issue, deforestation is a particular problem in rural and impoverished Central America, particularly Guatemala.  Following a decades long civil war, often backed by US interests with a Cold War fever, and culminating with reports of upwards of 200,000 indigenous Mayans being killed, things are slow to turn around.  Seeking safe ground often pushed populations farther and farther up into the hills, and mountains, to eek out a subsistence living on the steep slopes.  Trees were felled for fuel and to clear ground for crops.  Surviving on a dollar a day puts added pressure on getting the most out of the land you work; you must first take care of your family before you can concern yourself with the future.  Reports have indicated that 17% of Guatemala&#8217;s forests were felled in a 15 year period between 1990 and 2005.  </p>
<p>Guatemala sits in a narrow strip of land between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans making it a frequent target of hurricanes.  When rains batter these fragile mountainsides the land sloughs away destroying roads, communities, and livelihoods.  I was informed it is impossible for them to plan a Tour of Guatemala bike race (following the European icons, or others in Latin America) due to the regular landslides.  Road building has also been a prime source of corruption resulting in poorly constructed roads that deteriorate quickly.  Guatemala is on a steady rate of reversal following the end of the civil war in 1996.  And, where there is a will, a problem, and a way, someone steps in to turn things around.</p>

Such is the case with the reforestation work at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Proyecto-de-Reforestaci%C3%B3n-Chico-Mendes/161878030541679" title="Chico Mendes" target="_blank">Chico Mendes</a>, headed by Armando, just up the road from Quetzaltenando in Pachaj.  Lining the river and road along the 20 minute bus ride up to his farm are tall and mature trees that his organization planted.  This year they have nurtured 50,000 trees up from seedlings and are one step away from recovering a hillside; they need May to bring the rains.  The large planting efforts become a huge community event, connecting the people to their forests.  Seedlings have been started for a round of 150,000 trees next year.  Once his idea is planted in the minds of Guatemalans, and the successes are witnessed first hand, this project will continue to grow exponentially.  What is starting in the highlands near Xela, will spread out across the sweeping hills and valleys of Guatemala.  </p>

Bringing the trees up to saplings requires tedious hours of watering, monitoring, and moving.  Most of which is supplied by a flow of eager volunteers from Xela&#8217;s nearby language schools, and is where I come into the picture.  Idle time in Xela has gotten the best of me, but I was never willing to commit to a volunteer position for fear I would have to back out early and get back on the road.  I saw a few fellow students come into the school one afternoon tired, dirty, and sun-burnt &#8211; my ideal state.  Last week I tagged along and contributed to a future life for a few thousand trees; very rewarding work.  The sun at this altitude is abusive, and my body has lost its familiarity.  The dust and dirt of the roads and the farms form spindrift in the wind, and my lungs have lost their filter.  Grit and grime on the hands rub my palms raw and dry.  Soon, little green trees will cover a lost and abandoned hill-side providing needed stability for the ground, increase the local water supply, provide local and renewable resources, and bit by bit taking in a little of the pungent polluted air and giving back a bit of fresh oxygen.  A real win-win situation.  I was let loose to play outside in the dirt under the screaming sun, and Armando was able to further along his vision for a reforested Guatemala.<br />

<p>It is an inevitability that hair grows and will need to be cut.  Abroad, trips to the barber shop mark some of my favorite days and memories.  It keeps the incentive high for me to stick with the youthful short chop of a hairstyle.  It is easy, hassle-free, and keeps me from looking like an itinerant wanderer, hash hiding hippy,  and it means I get regular trips to the barbarias.  In Guatemala there are Barbers for the men, and different Salons for women.  It is like what I imagine the days of old being like, and even includes either the same barber poles, or the signifying rainbow pattern.  </p>
<p>Two lone chairs stand in the middle of the clean and empty barbershop facing opposite walls with mirrors.  The man jumped up from his waiting stool in the corner and quickly motioned me to have a seat.  If my hair were not so easy to cut, the language barrier would not prove too complicated, the room is lined with pictures of styles and options.  But, I just need to know how to say the number 3 guard on a trimmer, and we are off to the races.  He is moving at a pace suited for the dark, shiny black hair of the locals; my blond mop stutters the blades.  In minutes my hair is just a pile of fragments on the ground or upon my apron.  I feel refreshed and clean.  This would suffice to make me appreciate these hair-cutting days, but we don&#8217;t stop.  This is a barber shop, and so out comes the straight-blade razor to manicure the hairline and sideburns.  I relish in the care they take on my gringo head, which is sitting a bit to high for his slight stature; I slouch in the chair so he can reach my head.  With a mirror, he lets me see his craft.  It pleases me, and so on goes the aftershave, a quick brush around my face and neck, and then I am up and on my way.  Depending on the barbershop, my local treatment sets me back either just above or below 2 dollars.  I step into the sun and feel particularly self-conscious; a tall buzz cut gringo in a land of short men with slicked up black hair.  It is fun.  I can&#8217;t wait for another six weeks to pass and I can go explore another barbershop, maybe even in a new country.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was on the streets of Quetzaltenango before first light.  The air was crisp and refreshing, the city quiet in its early morning slumber.  There was no one up to light fireworks, or honk horns.  The walk up past the market, usually heaped with people and goods, was empty and expansive.  A few men dragged loads on dollies down the middle of the deserted calles.  When I hit the main thoroughfare, I climbed into the first camioneta to pass by, already filled with the first wave of morning commuters.  I was offloaded a block away from the buses, packed on a wide section of road substituting as a terminal, and sauntered through the dirty bowels of the terminal market.  When I emerged from under the tarped canopy of the market alley, the sky was picking up its first hint at day; pulling on its deep indigo pre-dawn shawl.  I was escorted to my first bus of the day, destined for San Marcos, and was underwhelmed by the lack of flair the chicken buses exude in the dark of night.  Their cloak of color and chrome meant for the bright Guatemalan sun.  On the bus I stuffed my tailbone into the back of the bench seat and wedged my knees against the seat in front of me, my uncomfortable position for the day.  Even at 6:30 in the morning the buses will roll through the first section of streets at less than a crawl.  They never pick up more passengers, so I am perplexed by the routine.  Once the left hand turn is made and we aim for the edge of town, the pedal is pressed, and the gears grinded.  The bus leans through the roundabout at the edge of town and pulls onto the curb to fill out its boarding.  When we are wedged three deep to a bench we depart.  Fog blankets much of the mountainsides, and a glint of frost is exposed by the morning sun as it sweeps across the valleys of fields.  With my hood pulled up I am happy, it is a beautiful morning.</p>
<p>The bus navigates the narrow streets leading through San Marcos with the assistant directing traffic on the roads and gauging clearances from surrounding cars, curbs, and power-poles.  They know the space their bus occupies much better that I know the size of my bike.  I switch to bus number 2 a few seconds before it pulls out of the terminal.  Timing always seems to be close, but in reality, they wait for all the arriving buses in order to swap changing passengers.  It is a remarkably efficient system clouded in a swarm of chaotic activity.  Out of San Marcos we immediately begin our descent to the sweltering lowlands.  The cool crisp air is being exchanged for heat and tepidity.  Three to a seat.</p>
<p>I am given the empty front seat of the camioneta.  We are slowly cruising the roads out of Malacatan urging pedestrians to change their destinations for the Mexican border.  A school parade is blocking our path.  The children dressed up in costumes for Carnival walking down the middle of the road with the parents by their side.  We honk, hoot, and holler.  At the edge of town is a young girl, high-school age, and I catch the young aid tell the driver that she has his heart.  My spanish is now letting me eavesdrop.  Yet, the crafty lad took me for more Quetzals than I should have parted with, so my spanish is still limited.</p>
<p>At the border town of El Carmen, I am graciously allowed to leave Guatemala (for $1.30 or Q10).  I cheat and don&#8217;t even bother going to Mexico, instead I walk across the street and into an air-conditioned hotel restaurant.  The Nescafe and huevos rancheros are nearly good enough to make the 5 hour morning journey worth it, almost.  Another cup of brown water with a slight taste of coffee and a Mexican soap opera on TV burn away just enough time for me to happily decide to go back to Guatemala.  Being a nobody in between borders isn&#8217;t nearly as good as being a somebody somewhere.  My new passport has only seen stamps from Mexico and Guatemala.  He deposits another directly next to my exit stamp 30 minutes previous.  I am supposed to stay out of the country for a full 3 days before a new visa is allowed; he does not mention this.  For Q10 I am allowed back into Guatemala.</p>
<p>Again I am offered the front seat of the camioneta as I rewind my mornings motions.  El Carmen to Malacatan with my arm out the front passenger window.  I notice trees with leaves the goldest yellow I have seen outside of a Colorado Aspen.  Not all of them, just a few, and it is winter, but hot; I am confused.  A crowded bus back to San Marcos.  Initially, we are all compressed in a hot mass, sweaty arms sticking together; uncomfortable intimacy without a shared word.  People disembark the bus, and we climb back up.  Windows are closed and the air returns to breathable.  A crowded bus back to Xela, home.  I have a Coke as a treat for enduring the 7 buses it took to renew my visa; 90 more days between Mexico and Costa Rica.  I hold onto the bottle until after the bus reaches Xela and throw it in a trash bin.  Maybe next time I will do as they do and throw it out the bus window.</p>
<p>There are two sides to every place; this time the buses crowd the streets, squeezing out air and replacing it with exhaust.  Chrome shines in the hot afternoon sun, and the hulking buses proudly show off their colors.  People are running, luggage swinging behind them.  I start walking home, the wind stirred dust and exhaust making my eyes water.  The streets are familiar, even the potholes are familiar.  I see friendly faces and am happy to be back.  I go to Yoga and try to flush out the tension of the days buses.  A good conversation finishes off my night.  No-one truly knows what will happen next, but no-one is more excited to find out than I am.</p>
