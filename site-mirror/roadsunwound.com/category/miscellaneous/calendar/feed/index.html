				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the last chance for calendars before I make a personal call to each of my dear supporters who have yet to get a calendar and beg you directly.  There isn&#8217;t much time between now and new years, so don&#8217;t let yourself be lost on January 1st without a calendar and any clue as to what day of the week it is (assuming you don&#8217;t turn on your phone, computer, and have destroyed last years calendar, and don&#8217;t receive a daily paper).  There are a dozen left, and in the interest of getting them out the door and into some homes, the remaining ones are going for $20.  Also, if you are in Bozeman I may even be able to hand deliver the calendar on my brief visit to town for New Years!  Anyone who has already purchased a calendar and is concerned about the lowered price can find me somewhere on the road and I will buy you a beer (seriously!).  You can purchase a calendar from my Etsy store here: <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/61206963/2011-calendar?ref=pr_shop">Etsy &#8211; roadsunwound</a>.  Or, you may make an appropriate donation to my site on the sidebar (please indicate that the donation is for a calendar).  Thanks again for all your unwavering support of such an interesting and wavering character and my trip. </p>
