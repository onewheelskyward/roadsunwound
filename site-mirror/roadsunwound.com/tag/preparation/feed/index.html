				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I guess this makes it official &#8211; the great bike ride from Deadhorse, Alaska to Ushuaia, Argentina is on! I anticipate leaving sometime in July and spending approximately18 months traveling through the Americas by my own peddle power.  This site will most certainly change in the future, as this is simply the default layout provided to me.  I expect this to be my main means of relaying information, from updates to articles, photos and videos, stats and anything else I can conjure up.  I would like to answer an all to familiar question, &#8220;why&#8221;, and say that we all have an opportunity to live the life that we dream, to never look back and hold no regrets.  This is an incredibly daunting undertaking, but here is something I wrote to myself as I was analyzing the reason for attempting this trip:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To live and to learn</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To see and to show</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To write and be read</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To discuss and be discussed,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To struggle and to succeed</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To collapse and to grow</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To need and to find</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To amaze and be amazed.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">For those of you who are already reading this, I would like to express a sincere &#8220;Thank You&#8221; for all of your support now, and to come.  I am trying not to place to much pressure on those close to me, but as this challenge approaches and the pressure of the preparation and ride get closer I appreciate all the support.  Please keep checking in as I make updates and drastic changes to the site, and to keep me on track as I further prepare for my ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211; Justin &#8211;</p>
