		<description><![CDATA[Excellent website. It sounds like you have all sorts of ideas for making cyber-ready for your journey. I bet that I could get a few of us in the Florentine clan to pound out some miles to match yours....especially Papa Flo, who likes very much to ride bikes. Keep up the good work! I&#039;m excited for your long ride!]]></description>
