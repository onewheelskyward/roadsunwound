(That means effing flats in Spanish...or at least in my version of Spanish...which I suppose you won&#039;t be using for a long stretch yet...unless there are some Spanish speaking folks in the Alaskan bush you might encounter.) Never doubt what the Gods have in store for you! Surely it is greatness and adventure! Chin up, mi amigo. Chin up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll tell ya how you can get over all that anxiety and stress, sounds like you need a little release and it is time to go fishing.  Even if it is just for a bit and it really doesn&#039;t matter if you catch the prettiest fish in the river, its all about your surroundings.  
Anyways, hope things start coming together more smoothly for ya and after drinking my fill of Leine&#039;s back in the midwest, I am down to the last couple in the fridge.  Looks like it is back to Oly&#039;s and Ranier for a while.

Take care and pedal hard.
