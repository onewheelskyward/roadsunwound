		<description><![CDATA[So excited for you! I hope that in the coming months of mountain gazing you are able to be in the moment as much as you were in your plane-ride gazing. Let your worries come and go as they may, and enjoy the journey! We will miss you in Bozeman (esp. at 511) but we&#039;ll all be thinking fondly of you and wishing you well and sending you lots of positive energy. Take every chance you get to have &quot;tribal dance moments&quot; with the people you meet along the way and blog often!]]></description>
