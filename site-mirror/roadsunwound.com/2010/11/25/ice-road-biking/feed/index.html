		<description><![CDATA[Good thing many a Bozeman winter trained you for dealing with numb extremities...although you haven&#039;t even had the usual cold-season-training session of the Christmas stroll! We haven&#039;t either, and already it has been way below zero. Ah, Montana winters. 

Your comment about being strange and different reminded me of a quote from elementary school that has always stuck with me:

&quot;To be weird is to be different, to be different is to be unique, to be unique is to be special, so why be normal?&quot;

Just take care while you are being special and ice road biking! 
Lots of love from everyone here at 511.]]></description>
