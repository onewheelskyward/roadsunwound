		<description><![CDATA[I think one calender with a combo of color and black and white,  And I think it would be best to match photos to the month instead of chronological order.

How fun, I can&#039;t wait to have one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love B&#038;W, so that&#039;s great with me, but I also know that people love color, so that would be fine, too. It&#039;s not a hardship for me to choose, but it seems like it would be easier for you to do just one? You are darling to worry about us, but I would say just do what you most want to do and it will work for me/us. As for what images when, I&#039;m not sure that it matters what order they are in, but I like the idea of images somewhat reflective of the month they are in. Chronology might matter more after your trip is all done and it will be fun to track it in its entirety. That&#039;s my four cents.]]></description>
