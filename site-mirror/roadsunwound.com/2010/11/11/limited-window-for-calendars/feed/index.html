		<description><![CDATA[I will complete our order for two tomorrow, but why don&#039;t you send the calendars to me and the orders can come to me to send? That&#039;s crazy for you to do that, and I&#039;m happy to help. I imagine that most of my friends will buy one, they might just not do it this quickly. Will that help?]]></description>
