		<description><![CDATA[Hi Justin,
You are an amazing young man. More power to you. I have friends in Carmel that would love to have you stay with them. If you are heading down  Highway 1 then, it will be perfect. We all went to Carmel Pres. church &#038; they lead our bible study. They would love to have you. When do you think you might be there. They are very involved in the live nativity scene for the church right in the little town of Carmel. You would love them &#038; all that they do.
Hugs&#038; Love,
Joyce]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ll be fine if you get through Tijuana.

But seriously, a couple of years ago Brian from Telluride motorbiked all around Mexico and down to Panama without any problems.  Except for various equipment malfunctions and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll see, probably already have, plenty of those.

Enjoy the Pacific Coast!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yo dude, love the updates and introspective thought so far.  I am glad you are putting so much thought into the day to day tasks at hand rather than stressing about big picture objectives that, when it boils down to it, you really have no control over anyways.  I hope you are getting to spend some quality time with Max, Tucker, Sara and Quincy.  Enjoy the good seafood and ocean views.  Bozeman is not going anywhere.  Can&#039;t wait to read more.

		<description><![CDATA[Last I checked you were more than just a little afraid of killer sharks. Wasn&#039;t it that fear did not allow you to venture onto the frozen surface of Hyalite? Hahahaha. Only kidding. I bet I don&#039;t have that completley correct. But it makes a good joke. 

I, for one, am glad to know that someone we all care so much about is being thoughtful about his safety and well-being in his reflections on risk. Adventure on and continue to take care!]]></description>
