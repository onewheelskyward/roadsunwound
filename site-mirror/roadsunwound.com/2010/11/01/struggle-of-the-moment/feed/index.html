		<description><![CDATA[I remember my dad gave me a card when I was deciding what college to go to that read &quot;do not anguish over past decisions.&quot;I think the Buddhists (and my dad) have it right that letting go of anguish is key (albeit difficult). Decisions come and go, time is a weird thing, and all we ever really have is this moment, you know? I just read The Art of Racing in the Rain, by Garth Stein, which talks about that a lot. I&#039;d recommend it regardless of whether you decide to rest your head on the fleece-wrapped bean bag or the down-filled pillow. :)]]></description>
