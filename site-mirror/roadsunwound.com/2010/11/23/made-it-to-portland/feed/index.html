		<description><![CDATA[Geeze, Justin, I know you miss skiing....but skiing slush in the road on your bicycle seems like a poor substitute. Just kidding. Glad to know you made it safe to Portland and that you have enough sense to warm up when you need to. Take care, keep us posted, happy turkey, and see you in San Fran sometime around Dec.10-19!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Justin! I just caught up on the blog. It sounds very eventful indeed. I am in Salt Lake City, as the storm that plagued you is now upon I-15. I&#039;m on my way back to Colorado for the rest of the season, and thinking of you often. An email soon - keep up the good updates and good luck with the weather. Seems like you&#039;ve been making good decisions, stay safe!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you&#039;re safe and sound, and VERY glad I didn&#039;t read the other post earlier. Knowing you were going to suffer through swerving cars and slush would have caused me to nail your feet to the floor of some hotel. I know, I know, you already have a mother! Happy Thanksgiving.]]></description>
