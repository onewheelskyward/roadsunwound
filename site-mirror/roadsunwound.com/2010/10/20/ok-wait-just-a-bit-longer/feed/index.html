		<description><![CDATA[Hola,

Martha and I passed quite a few spanish cyclists today on the road between Tarifa and Arcos and thought of you.  Our few travel hiccups and complaints seemed trivial as we talked about your trek and accomplishments thus far.  Glad to see you´re either in or near Seattle.  Rest well and we´ll try and catch up with you when we are all in the U.S.

p.s. Hello to all the Stevens (Stevenses?) when you see them.]]></description>
