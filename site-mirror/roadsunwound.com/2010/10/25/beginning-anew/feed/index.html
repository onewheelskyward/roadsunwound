		<description><![CDATA[Glad to hear you made it to Seattle, it looks like you just scooted in before the rains hit hard yesterday. I was out riding this weekend and it was wonderfully lovely.

If you would like to get a cup of coffee while you are in Seattle town, just let me know.

Happy Riding,

Cheers
