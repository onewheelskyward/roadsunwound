		<description><![CDATA[Hells, yeah! Just caught up on the blog after a week in Kauai. So my life is sucking way less than it was in the summer, thank you very much! Anyway, hope you get to Vancouver without hitting any bad weather. If you&#039;re looking for a distraction in Vancouver, I know a guy in Victoria that would certainly enjoy hosting you if you want to explore Vancouver Island. He&#039;s a big sea kayak and  hockey guy and does quite a bit of world travel. He, his wife and two daughters are very cool so let me know if you&#039;re interested in another side trip!

The stories are fantastic, very colorful, and hold the readers intrerest. Glad to here you have taken some time to wonder off the main HWY to see the Rocky Mountains of Canada. Ride safe!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SO great to see you and to meet Nathan! Our jaunt up to the Great Sunny North (it turns out) was just what I needed too. I think that had you have gotten in the car with us you would have enjoyed a week, maybe two in Bozeman...then would have gotten restless and lustful for the road again. So keep on keepin&#039; on, my man. &quot;Fight the good fight!&quot; and all the rest. Lots of support still coming your way from all your friends here in the ever constant &#039;zone. Enjoy! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As always, it&#039;s such pure pleasure to read about your experiences and your thoughts. I love that you&#039;ve transitioned from destination to experience. The side trip to Jasper/Banff seems to be what the real trip would best be about. You can then call the southward pushes the &quot;side&quot; trips! We&#039;re off to Spain on Thursday so won&#039;t be able to stay in touch until November 1, but that will make it like Christmas--I&#039;ll get to open up a lot of posts/presents all at once!]]></description>
