		<description><![CDATA[You write well and with truth and integrity ... not suprising.  My heart goes out to you as you write about the difficulties and the downer moods and it soars when you talk about the wonders of it all.  My thoughts and prayers continue to be with you.  Hugs -- Vic]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Martha...your posts are a treat to read; your honesty about the road is moving and so translatable to the road of life we all travel. Keep your chin up and your heart open and your judgment minimal. What will come will come...and you will pedal through it, 100 strokes at a time. Much love from all your peeps in Bozeman!!!!]]></description>
