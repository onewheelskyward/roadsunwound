		<description><![CDATA[Justin,
Congratulation on you journey to Tok! Your ride from Tok to Whitehorse should be very enjoyable. Take your time and enjoy your ride. You still have 17 months to make your goal, you have many followers and well wishers; I for one enjoy reading your blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yup, hot headwinds suck! But glad to see you conquered The Dalton! I laughed when I realized you were riding that - I&#039;m a bit Ice Road Truckers fan and after having heard how treacherous Atigan Pass is in the winter, it was a hoot to see that you biked it. Hope you get some more tailwinds soon! Crossing into Canada will be a big emotional boost, I&#039;m sure.]]></description>
