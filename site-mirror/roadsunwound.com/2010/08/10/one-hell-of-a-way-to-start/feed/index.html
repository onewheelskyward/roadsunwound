		<description><![CDATA[Hey there buddy!  Wow - it seems so surreal that you are out there.  I am glad we chatted and hope you had the best of birthdays.  I have to share a little story from a certain 6 year old - Sully.  He was looking at a globe the other day and became quite frustrated.  So his friend&#039;s mom and I asked him what he was looking for and he said &quot;I&#039;m looking for the top country because my friend is there.&quot;  I was confused and named a few countries and showed them to him.  When I pointed to Alaska (yes, I realize this isn&#039;t a country), he exclaimed, &quot;Thats it, there it is!&quot;  And then he went on to tell his friend&#039;s mom about how his friend was riding his bike all the way from the top of the world to the bottom - and that&#039;s when I realized he was talking about you.  He kept saying, &quot;Isn&#039;t that cool?!  That&#039;s cool!&quot;  I think you have people cheering from you from every walk of life - big and small.  Keep those pedals cranking! - Aunge]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a magnificent post! I did tear up a bit, and I had a great laugh at the food intake with the macaroon finale. Justin you are an incredible person and an amazing writer. The fact that we get to live vicariously through you on this journey is something that we&#039;ll never be able to truly thank you for. Happy Birthday!]]></description>
