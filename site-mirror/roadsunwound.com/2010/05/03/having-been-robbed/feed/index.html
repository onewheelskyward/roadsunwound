		<description><![CDATA[I have crossed there Justin and it&#039;s a great idea. I was, unfortunately, on a bus that broke down in the middle of the night and ended up in Macara at an odd hour and then stranded for a while in one of the little towns just across the border. . . but it was fun. AND beautiful. I would not, however, recommend the combo hostel and fish restaurant that I stayed at in Loja. . . :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s the part of Peru where Aunge and I went mule riding!  Kuelap was amazing and that whole area was one of my favorite parts of Peru.  Sounds like a good alternative.  I&#039;ll call you soon...its been way too long!  I&#039;m glad all your adventure planning is going so well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds pretty killer! To take some of the anxiety off these last weeks of the planning phase of your trip I think we need to try out your gear in the Montana Rocky Mountains. The Crazies, perhaps?]]></description>
