		<description><![CDATA[Justin, nice to see you blogging again! Don&#039;t worry - I&#039;m 52 and still basically have no clear idea of who I am or what I&#039;m doing. Just think Hansel from Zoolander and you&#039;ll have a pretty good idea of how I&#039;m rolling these days. Caitlyn is sitting next to me as I type this and we are both psyched to catch up on your thoughts. I spent the summer of 1978 in and around Targhee and have fond memories of that area. So enjoy the summer working and catching up with friends. There&#039;s some chance that Susan and I will be in Bozeman in July so perhaps we&#039;ll overlap there for beers and biking. I&#039;ve told a few people at work about your awesome story of the Canadians that tried to steal your stuff and just couldn&#039;t - they are, after all, Canadians. Too funny!

best,
