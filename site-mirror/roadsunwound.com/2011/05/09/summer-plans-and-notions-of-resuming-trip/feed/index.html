		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the update!!  I can&#039;t wait for Targhee, though I will probably drive or ride in a car both to and from (I may try to bring my mountain bike...).  Also, I think this will be a perfect way to celebrate your 30th, after all, the first festival we went to in Targhee was during your birthday (was it your 25th???).  Woohoo!!]]></description>
