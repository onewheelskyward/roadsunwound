		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t have a chance to respond to the previous post before this one arrived. I so appreciate that you use these pages to let us in on your challenges, struggles, successes, experiences. I feel like I&#039;m watching a remarkable documentary that&#039;s being filmed and shown at the same time. I know that me telling you to let go of the guilt is pointless (after all, I&#039;m a German Catholic and we&#039;ve got guilt all sewn up), but you have to know somewhere inside that EACH of your decisions is the &quot;right&quot; one, and disappointment isn&#039;t even on the table. Can&#039;t wait for what&#039;s next!
PS, I made a cherry pie for your birthday, but you weren&#039;t here so we ate it. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
