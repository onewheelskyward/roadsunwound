		<description><![CDATA[You are a goof!!  At least the busy roads are flat and dry this year, remember where you were and what the roads were like exactly a year ago??  It&#039;s nice to know you aren&#039;t the star of Ice Road Bikers this year.  Glad to hear you are back on the southbound track :)  Miss you!]]></description>
